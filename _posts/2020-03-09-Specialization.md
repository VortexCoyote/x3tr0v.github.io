# An editor for osu!mania

## Screenshot
![](../assets/img/encore_1.png)

## Details:
- 5 Weeks Half-Time
- Written in C++ within openframeworks, with the ImGui and BASS library
- Had prepared a small engine for parsing beatmaps and rendering them before the start of the specialization course

## Goal and Purpose
The goal of my specialization course at The Game Assembly write an editor to a game called [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/), and for a specific gamemode within that game called [osu!mania](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!mania). The purpose of this project was to get more experience writing a tool for a specific game, while encountering new and unique problems along the way.

## What is osu!mania?

osu!mania is a so called "Vertically Scrolling Rhythm Game" (VSRG), which is loosely based on games such as Dance Dance Revolution, IIDX and Guitar Hero.
